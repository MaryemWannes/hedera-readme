# üåø certification.webapp

## üßæ Overview
`certification.webapp` is a **Next.js decentralized application (dApp)** designed for **document certification and verification** on the **Hedera network**.  
It allows users to **upload certification documents**, automatically process them through **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**, verify their plausibility, and **mint them as NFTs** to ensure authenticity and traceability.

This module is part of the GreenEarthX platform ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Main Purpose
- Enable document upload and validation.
- Trigger OCR extraction and plausibility checks.
- Tokenize verified certifications as NFTs on Hedera.
- Provide a user-friendly decentralized interface.

## üß© System Architecture

### Components Involved
| Component | Description | Local Port |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **certification.webapp** | Next.js dApp for upload, OCR trigger, NFT minting | 3002 |
| **OcrPlausibilityCheck** | Python FastAPI OCR service (Docker) | 8000 |
| **PlausibilityCheck** | Plausibility algorithm micro-service (Docker) | 8001 |
| **Hedera Network** | Handles HCS messaging and NFT minting | ‚Äî |

### Workflow
1. The user uploads a certification document.
2. The file is sent to `OcrPlausibilityCheck` for OCR text extraction.
3. The extracted data is verified by the `PlausibilityCheck` service.
4. Once validated, a **non-fungible token (NFT)** is minted on **Hedera** representing the certified document.
5. Document and metadata are stored on **IPFS** for decentralized access.
